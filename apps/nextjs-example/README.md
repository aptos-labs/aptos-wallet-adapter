# Aptos Wallet Adapter Demo App

This project is a demo of the Aptos Wallet Selector using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

A live version is hosted at:
https://aptos-labs.github.io/aptos-wallet-adapter

## Use shadcn/ui wallet selector for your own app

If you want to add the shadcn/ui Aptos wallet selector to your shadcn-based app, follow these steps:

- Follow the [shadcn/ui installation instructions](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation) if you haven't already configured it in your app.

- Run the following command to install all of the shadcn/ui components that the wallet selector depends on:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button collapsible dialog dropdown-menu toast
```

- Copy the [wallet-selector.tsx](./src/components/WalletSelector.tsx) file from this repo to your `src/components/` directory.

- If you have not already configured `AptosWalletAdapterProvider` for your app, you can also copy the [wallet-provider.tsx](./src/components/WalletProvider.tsx) file from this repo. Be sure to install the `@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react` package and the wallet adapter plugins for the wallet options you plan to support.

- Wrap your app with the `WalletProvider` component. See [layout.tsx](./src/app/layout.tsx) for an example.

- Render `<WalletSelector />` in your app where you want to place the "Connect Wallet" button. See [page.tsx](./src/app/page.tsx) as an example.

## Run demo app locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

# or
pnpm dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
